## Specific Documentation Examples

### Before (game.js):
```javascript
// Start preloading assets
init:function(){
    loader.init();
    mouse.init();
    sidebar.init();
    sounds.init();
```

### After (game.js):
```javascript
/**
 * GAME INITIALIZATION
 * Sets up all game systems and prepares the game for play.
 * This is called once when the page loads.
 * 
 * Initialization Process:
 * 1. Asset loading system - manages images and sounds
 * 2. Mouse input handling - processes user interactions
 * 3. UI sidebar controls - manages building and unit buttons
 * 4. Audio system - handles sound effects and music
 */
init: function(){
    // Initialize all subsystem managers
    loader.init();      // Asset loading system
    mouse.init();       // Mouse input handling
    sidebar.init();     // UI sidebar controls
    sounds.init();      // Audio system
```

### Before (common.js):
```javascript
// Finds the angle between two objects in terms of a direction
function findAngle(object,unit,directions){
    var dy = (object.y) - (unit.y);
    var dx = (object.x) - (unit.x);
    var angle = wrapDirection(directions/2-(Math.atan2(dx,dy)*directions/(2*Math.PI)),directions);   
    return angle;    
}
```

### After (common.js):
```javascript
/**
 * FIND ANGLE BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS
 * Calculates the direction from one object to another.
 * Returns an angle value suitable for sprite direction selection.
 * 
 * Mathematical Process:
 * 1. Calculate delta X and Y between objects
 * 2. Use atan2 to get angle in radians
 * 3. Convert to game's direction system (0 to directions-1)
 * 4. Wrap angle to ensure it's within valid range
 * 
 * @param {Object} object - Target object (what we're pointing toward)
 * @param {Object} unit - Source object (what we're pointing from)
 * @param {number} directions - Number of possible directions (usually 8)
 * @returns {number} Direction index (0 to directions-1)
 */
function findAngle(object, unit, directions){
    var dy = (object.y) - (unit.y);
    var dx = (object.x) - (unit.x);
    
    // Convert atan2 result to game direction system
    // atan2 returns -π to π, we convert to 0 to directions-1
    var angle = wrapDirection(directions/2 - (Math.atan2(dx, dy) * directions / (2 * Math.PI)), directions);   
    return angle;    
}
```
